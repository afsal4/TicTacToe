## Project Structure

- **assets/**: Contains assets for the UI elements of the game.
- **tictactoe.py**: Core file with the TicTacToe game logic and the Minimax algorithm implementation.
- **runner.py**: Main script to launch the game. Run this file to start playing.
- **requirements.txt**: Lists the required libraries for the project.

## Features

- **Unbeatable AI**: The AI uses the Minimax algorithm to evaluate every possible outcome and make the best possible move.
- **Optimal Strategy**: The AI is guaranteed to play perfectly, making a win impossible for the player.
- **Interactive UI**: The game includes a visually appealing, easy-to-navigate interface.

## How It Works

The AI's gameplay is powered by the **Minimax algorithm**, which enables it to:

1. **Explore All Moves**: The AI evaluates all potential moves and their outcomes, ensuring it plays optimally.
2. **Score Assignments**: Each end state (win, draw, or loss) is given a score, and the AI selects moves that maximize its chances of winning.
3. **Optimal Decision-Making**: By minimizing the playerâ€™s chances of winning and maximizing its own, the AI is guaranteed to be unbeatable.

## Installation

1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/afsal4/TicTacToe.git
   cd tictactoe
   ```

2. **Install dependencies**:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

3. **To Run the game**:
    ```bash
    python runner.py
    ```

## How to Play

1. **Start the Game**: Run `python runner.py` in your terminal.
2. **Make Your Move**: Use the UI to place your move (X or O).
3. **Compete Against the AI**: Try to achieve a draw since the AI will always play optimally.

## Minimax Algorithm

The Minimax algorithm ensures that the AI always makes the best possible move by:

- **Recursive Evaluation**: Evaluating every potential board state up to the end of the game.
- **Optimal Play**: Selecting moves that lead to a win or draw, ensuring it cannot be defeated.
